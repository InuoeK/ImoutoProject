Simple Natural Language Processing 

What I tried to do was create my own natural language processing by using a keyword scoring system. Certain words are assigned points (positive and negative)

Text processing work is done in TextProcessor.cs. Multithreading was also implemented as a precaution in case the number of word dictionaries used by the text processor numbered too many.
